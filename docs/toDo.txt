Implement Pipelines:
- Shuffle the data before training (since the data is ordered).
- Apply StandardScaler (although in this case, the features are already on a similar scale, so it might not provide significant improvement).
- Use GridSearchCV to select the best model based on hyperparameter optimization.
- Automatically encode the labels using LabelEncoder() instead of manually creating a mapping dictionary.
